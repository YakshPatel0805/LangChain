LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models.
It helps with prompt management, chaining calls, memory, and document retrieval.
LangChain is commonly used for chatbots, RAG systems, and AI agents.

Key Features of LangChain:
1. Document Loaders: Load documents from various sources like PDFs, text files, web pages
2. Text Splitters: Break down large documents into manageable chunks
3. Embeddings: Convert text into vector representations for similarity search
4. Vector Stores: Store and retrieve document embeddings efficiently
5. Chains: Combine multiple components to create complex workflows
6. Memory: Maintain conversation context across interactions
7. Agents: Create autonomous systems that can use tools and make decisions

Common Use Cases:
- Question Answering Systems: Build systems that can answer questions from documents
- Chatbots: Create conversational AI applications
- Document Summarization: Automatically summarize large documents
- Content Generation: Generate content based on existing documents
- Research Assistants: Help users find information from large document collections

LangChain supports various LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and local models.
It also integrates with vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS for efficient document retrieval.
